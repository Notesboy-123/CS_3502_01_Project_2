# CS_3502_01_Project_2
This is a program created to simulate the Shortest Remaining Time First and Highest Response Ratio Next scheduling algorithms, with a paper about my findings based on the program.

## Usage:
1) Copy or download [CPU_Scheduler_Project.py](https://github.com/Notesboy-123/CS_3502_01_Project_2/blob/main/CPU_Scheduler_Project.py)
2) Run the code in a Python compiler
### Optional
3) Change the random numbers used for n, arrival, and burst to change the scenario used in the simulation.
